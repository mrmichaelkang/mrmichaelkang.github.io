Welcome! This is my website, made with only HTML, CSS and Javascript! No framework used! I decided to challenge myself to create a website with no framework and to see how I would go about create some of the features like the scroll transition of the navbar.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Challenges
The challenges that were faced during this project helped me understand how CSS properties work and how to leverage the box model on my website. Learning how to adjust the content of my website with only pure CSS was challenging, but with the help of flexbox, I was able to achieve the mobile responsiveness of my website. Another challenge I faced was the creation of my navbar. Learning how to use DOM to manipulate elements on my website really helped me create the mobile menu interface and the ability to add visibilty to my navbar as the user scrolls down.

## Summary
This project was a great way to applied my understanding of HTML, CSS and Javscript. With a lot of research, I was able to design and create a website that satisfies my needs. It help me understand what my strengths and weaknesses are when creating a project that is of larger scale to a university project.
